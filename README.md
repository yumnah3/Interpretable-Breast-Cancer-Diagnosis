## About The Project

While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models, the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavours more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique, STEM, can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN), and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between-class and within-class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets.
